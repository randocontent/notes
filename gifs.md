## Tools for creating and editing GIFs on Mac

- [Gifox 2 for Mac ‚Äì Delightful GIF Recording and Sharing App](https://gifox.io/) - Menu bar app, similar to CloudApp and Droplr. 
- [GIF Brewery by Gfycat](https://gfycat.com/gifbrewery) - Convert videos to GIFs. Can stitch images to videos which can then be converted, but doesn't appear to allow stitching images directly to GIFs. 
- [Cockos Incorporated - LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) - "LICEcap can capture an area of your desktop and save it directly to .GIF." Free and open source.
- [onmyway133/GifCapture: üèá Gif capture app for macOS](https://github.com/onmyway133/GifCapture/blob/master/LICENSE.md) - As far as I can tell, identical to LiceCap, but has a much better icon.
