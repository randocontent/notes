Vim cheat sheets. Some of these are pretty clever.

It looks like a keyboard overlay, except it's not actually meant to go over your keyboard. There's a lot here, but it's kind of messy. Figuring out the intricacies of the design of this cheat sheet is probably a good proxy for figuring out the intricacies of the design of Vim's control scheme.

Not sure what's the point of designing a command reference around a keyboard layout. 

The most important information is how the commands can be logically grouped to make them easier to remember, and how they can be used together to make them more useful. The least important information is where the keys that trigger the commands happen to be on the keyboard. 

This one has a nice twist though â€“ it's broken down into seven lessons that help you learn and practice Vim progressively:

- Basic editing, including `hjkl wWbBeE $ ^ iA xX`
- Operators and repetition, including `tTfF d c vV .`
- Yank and paste, including `oO pP y "`
- Searching, including `/? nN #*`
- Marks and macros, including `m ' q @`
- Various motions, including `HML G K {} [] () -+ %`
- Various commands, including `~ = Y sS J r D C <>`
