- [Programming Fonts - Test Drive](https://www.programmingfonts.org/) - very nice for previewing fonts inside a simulated text editor (with a bunch of themes and code snippets from different langauges)
- [List of monospaced typefaces - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_monospaced_typefaces)

## Menlo

[Menlo (typeface) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_%28typeface%29): "Menlo is a monospaced sans-serif typeface designed by Jim Lyles. The face first shipped with Mac OS X Snow Leopard. Menlo is based upon the Open Source font Bitstream Vera and the public domain font Deja Vu."

## Cascadia Code ⭐️

Stylized, quite fun, but very heavy. No weights or italics. Ligatures.

From Microsoft.

## Courier Prime

"Designed for screenplays"

Too wide and pretty generic.

## Inconsolata

Small. Looks a bit off.

## Andale Mono

Tons of letter spacing. 

- [Andale Mono](!s)

## Cousine

Round and friendly. Feel more like a standard sans-serif. Probably better for Markdown than JS.

Proper 0 (with a dot), no ligatures.

## Droid Sans Mono 

Similar to Cousine. No italics, no ligatures.

## Oxygen Mono ⭐

Narrow and tall, somewhat reminds me of JetBrains Mono but much more natural and rounded.

No italic, no weights, no ligatures. 

Quite readable. 

Designed for KDE.

## Office Code Pro

Generally too wide and rounded.

Comes in two different versions, with 0 either crossed or dotted. 

Italics and several weights. No ligatures.

## Liberation Mono

Nice, narrow.

[Liberation fonts - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_fonts)

## Input

Highly customizable, including line height. No ligatures. 

Highly boxy and square, even more than JetBrains Mono.

## Hack

Very nice. No ligatures.

## PT Mono

Type-writer style, kind of like Courier. Not a favorite. 

I have a bold version of it but not sure where from.

## Lekton

Very thin, not really usable.

## Cutive

Too light, too much height contrast, not usable.

## IBM Plex Mono ⭐️

Very beautiful. No ligatures.
