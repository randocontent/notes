## Useful patterns

` [^A-Za-z]+ ` - Match any special character, including accents and other things that some people won't consider "special". In VS Code this can be combined with Opt+Enter to select all matches and then Cmd+L to expand selection to all matching lines, which can then be easily edited or deleted. This can be useful for cleaning up a list.

` ^(?:[\t ]*(?:\r?\n|\r))+ ` - Match empty lines.

` ^(.*)(\r?\n\1)+$ ` - Match duplicate lines

Find: `^(\w+)\s*\n` Replace: `'$1'\n` – Wrap lines in `'`
